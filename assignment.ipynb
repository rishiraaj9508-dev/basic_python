        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax, readability, and large community support. It is popular because it is beginner-friendly, cross-platform, and widely used in fields like web development, data science, AI, automation, cybersecurity, and scripting. Its huge library ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, Django, TensorFlow) makes complex tasks easy. Python’s flexibility and ease of learning contribute to its global popularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line. Instead of converting the entire program into machine code at once (like a compiler), it translates and runs each line immediately. Python’s interpreter makes debugging easier, supports dynamic typing, and allows interactive execution using the Python shell or IDEs. This is why Python is slower than compiled languages but far more flexible and easy to test.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and purposes. They define the language’s syntax and structure, such as if, else, while, for, True, False, class, import, etc. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers or variable names. They help Python understand what kind of operation or statement you want to perform. Python has a fixed list of such reserved keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "No, Python keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for specific functions within the language. If you try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will generate a syntax error. For example, using for = 10 or class = \"A\" is not allowed. This restriction ensures that Python’s syntax remains clear and prevents confusion during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutability refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created. Mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) allow modifications such as adding, removing, or altering elements. Immutable objects (like strings, integers, tuples) cannot be changed once created; any modification creates a new object. Understanding mutability helps in memory management, debugging, and writing efficient programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are designed for dynamic data where elements may change, so Python stores them in a flexible memory structure that supports modifications. Tuples, on the other hand, are meant for fixed collections of data, so Python stores them in a compact, unchangeable format. Making tuples immutable improves performance, enables safe use as dictionary keys, and ensures data integrity. The design difference is intentional to serve different use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The == operator checks if two objects have the same value, while the is operator checks if they are the same object in memory. For example, two lists may contain identical elements (== returns True), but they are stored in different memory locations (is returns False). The is operator is mainly used for checking identity, such as comparing with None.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate truthfulness. Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "and → True if both conditions are True\n",
        "\n",
        "or → True if at least one condition is True\n",
        "\n",
        "not → reverses the boolean value\n",
        "These operators help in decision-making processes within conditions, loops, and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting refers to converting one data type into another. Python allows converting between types like integers, floats, strings, lists, and sets using functions such as int(), float(), str(), list(), etc. Type casting is essential when performing operations requiring specific types, user input handling, and data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit type casting is automatically performed by Python when it converts data types without programmer instruction—for example, converting an integer to a float during arithmetic. Explicit type casting requires manual conversion using functions like int(), float(), or str(). Explicit casting is used when Python cannot safely convert data on its own or when specific formats are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements help Python programs make decisions based on conditions. They allow different blocks of code to run depending on whether a condition is True or False. With if, elif, and else, programs can control the flow of execution, respond to user input, validate data, and handle multiple situations effectively. They form the foundation of logical decision-making in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "The elif statement allows checking multiple conditions after an initial if condition fails. Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom and executes the first one that is True. If if is False, it checks elif; if all conditions fail, it executes else (if present). This prevents writing multiple nested if statements and makes code cleaner and more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "A for loop iterates over a sequence (list, string, range) for a fixed number of repetitions. It is used when you know the number of iterations. A while loop continues running as long as a condition remains True, making it suitable for situations where repetition depends on logic rather than a sequence. For loops are deterministic; while loops are condition-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "A while loop is better when the number of repetitions is unknown and depends on a condition. For example, repeatedly asking a user for correct login input until they enter the right password. Since you don’t know how many attempts the user needs, a while loop keeps running until the condition becomes True. It is ideal for event-driven or unpredictable processes."
